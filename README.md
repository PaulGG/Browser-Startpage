# Custom Browser Page

__The up to date release of this project will be maintained [here on the Angular page.](https://github.com/PaulGG/Browser-Startpage-Angular) This is the old javascript version.__

It is encouraged to use the Angular version as I have taken user feedback and added more customizable settings on that version of the project. A usable version can be found under the releases tab.
